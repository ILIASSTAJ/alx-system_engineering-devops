Project Readme
Welcome to our project! In this endeavor, we will be exploring and implementing various concepts related to web infrastructure and networking. Below are the key areas that we will be focusing on:

Concepts to Explore
DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a crucial component of the internet that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. We will delve into the working principles of DNS, how it resolves domain names, and its importance in web applications.

Monitoring: Monitoring plays a vital role in ensuring the health and performance of our web infrastructure. We will explore different monitoring tools and techniques to keep a close eye on server health, application performance, and network metrics.

Web Server: The web server is the core of any web application. We will study different web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS, and learn how to configure and optimize them to serve web pages efficiently.

Network Basics: Understanding the basics of networking is essential for building a robust web infrastructure. We will cover topics like IP addressing, subnetting, routing, firewalls, and how they contribute to overall network security and performance.

Load Balancer: Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent overload. We will explore load balancing algorithms and implement a load balancer to improve application scalability and availability.

Server: Servers form the backbone of our web infrastructure. We will learn how to set up and configure servers, manage server resources, and secure them to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
